Our flagship product, LUSHRIDE, is a car-hailing service that raises
e-riders consciousness on their carbon footprint (COe) during
driving sessions. We're currently leveraging the XRPL robust chain
to create NFT tokens for users' carbon footprints, with the aim of
giving them a choice of monetizing or analysing their data for
global climate change mitigation.
